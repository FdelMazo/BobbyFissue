Play chess games inside Github issues!

[Check out the whole demo!](https://github.com/FdelMazo/BobbyFissue/issues/28)

### How do I play?

Just start a new issue inside this repo that starts with `[CHESS]`, or click this beautiful [link](https://github.com/FdelMazo/BobbyFissue/issues/new?title=[CHESS])

### What does it do?

This repo has some custom gh actions which take an issue comment and play the move written. The comment should contain only the player's move, written in SAN notation.

It should take around 10/20 seconds to update the board.

### Are you good at chess?

No.

### Can I see your matches?
