### How do I play?

Just start a new issue inside this repo that starts with `[CHESS]`, or click this beautiful [link](https://github.com/FdelMazo/BobbyFissue/issues/new?title=[CHESS])

10 seconds later, the bot will comment each player's color and show an initial board. If you are white, just comment your opening move! if you are black, wait for your turn! I'm gonna monitor this constantly, so no more than a day later than a match started I'm gonna comment my moves.

The issue's comment should only contain the move to be played in [SAN notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)).

### What does it do?

This repo has some custom gh actions which take an issue comment and play the move written. 

It should take around 10/20 seconds to update the board, so the idea is to have a more slow-paced game. Just start an issue, go on with your day, and make a move once in a while.
